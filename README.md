## Python projects 
This respository contains code for several projects I completed while transitioning from Matlab to Python.

diceRolling.Py: User specifies the number of sides on each die and how many dice they want to roll. User can roll the dice as many times as they want. At the end program produces a histogram of the values of each die for all of the rolls from that session.

guessTheNumber.Py: Program produces a number between 1 and a maximum value specified by the user and gives feedback as the user guesses a number until the user guesses correctly.
