## Python projects 
This respository contains code for several projects I completed while transitioning from Matlab to Python.

diceRolling.py: User specifies the number of sides on each die and how many dice they want to roll. User can roll the dice as many times as they want. At the end, the program produces a histogram of the values of each die for all of the rolls from that session.

guessTheNumber.py: Program produces a number between 1 and a maximum value specified by the user and gives feedback as the user guesses a number until the user guesses correctly. At the end of each game the program produces a plot that shows all of the user's guesses.

hangman.py: Hangman game that can be played with one or two players. In two player mode, one player enters a word and the other guesses (word is hidden in terminal as second player types). In one player mode the word is randomly selected from a preset list that came from: https://github.com/Xethron/Hangman/blob/master/words.txt.
